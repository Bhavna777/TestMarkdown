# What is MyTask, Assignments, All Tasks in Work Tab?

## My Tasks
This section displays all the tasks that have been assigned to you personally. It's a convenient way for you to keep track of your individual responsibilities.

## Assignments
In the Assignments section, you can view not only the tasks that have been assigned to you but also the tasks that you have assigned to others. This provides a comprehensive view of your workload, including both tasks you're responsible for and tasks you've delegated.

## All Tasks
The All Tasks section is designed for administrators or team leaders. Here, you can see all tasks across your team or organization, even if a team member has created a task and assigned it to another member. This provides transparency and oversight, allowing you to monitor all ongoing tasks within your group.
